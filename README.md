# cdx2spdx

Prototype utility that converts SBOM documents from [CycloneDX](https://cyclonedx.org/) to [SPDX](https://spdx.dev/).

## Status
This code is still under development and may not be considered stable.

## Usage
`java -jar cdx2spdx-[version]-jar-with-dependencies.jar cyclonedx.json spdx.json`

where `cyclonedx.json` is an existing CycloneDX JSON file and `spdx.json` is a file path to the resulting SPDX file generated from the CycloneDX file.

Although not tested, XML formats should work for CycloneDX and all supported SPDX files formats should work for the output file (e.g. tag/value, XLSX, XML, RDF/XML, YAML).

### Dockerfile

You can also use the included Dockerfile to run this tool using the following build commands. Please note that the input file names are hardcoded in the Dockerfile as `cyclonedx.json` and `spdx.json` and should be changed according to the desired result.

`docker build -t cdx2spdx .`

`docker run -v <directory where cyclonedx.json is located>:/cdx2spdx/sboms  -it --rm cdx2spdx`

## Design and Implementation Notes

The mappings from CycloneDX to SPDX can be found in the [SPDX-CycloneDX-Mapping Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PIiSYLJHlt8djG5OoOYniy_I-J31UMhBKQ62UUBHKVA/edit?usp=sharing).

SPDX properties highlighted in yellow do not map directly.  SPDX properties higlighted in light orange map, but has some possible exceptions listed in the notes.

Any CycloneDX properties which do not map to an existing SPDX property is added as an Annotation with `AnnotationType=OTHER` and the comment using the following format:

`MISSING_CDX_PROPERTY:<propertyname>=<propertyJSONvalue>`

where `<propertyname>` is the CycloneDX property name and `<propertyJSONvalue>` is a JSON string representation of the property value.

CycloneDX Components are mapped to SPDX Packages in most cases. For the CycloneDX type file, if there are any properties which require a package (e.g. supplier, originator), the component is converted to an SPDX package with the packageFileName having the value of the component name.  If a CycloneDX type file has no package properties, it is converted to an SPDX File.  This is basically a Duck Typing approach to distinguish CycloneDX files which have distribution information consistent with an SPDX package from CycloneDX files which do not contain SPDX package level information.

## Development

  * Clone requires sub modules to run test suite

      git submodule update --init --recursive

    To run the unit test suite, you will need to include the git submodules that contain various test resources.
    Otherwise, you may see test errors like the ones below:

        testAllSbomExamples(org.spdx.cdx2spdx.CycloneToSpdxTest)  Time elapsed: 0.005 sec  <<< ERROR!
        java.nio.file.NoSuchFileException: src/test/resources/bom-examples/SBOM
                at java.base/sun.nio.fs.UnixException.translateToIOException(UnixException.java:92)

    or:

        org.spdx.cdx2spdx.CycloneConversionException: File src/test/resources/specification/tools/src/test/resources/1.4/valid-bom-1.4.json does not exist.

    Run the command below after a normal `git clone` to also pull down submodules required by the test suite:

        git submodule update --init --recursive

    After running the above command, `./mvnw clean package` should succeed.
